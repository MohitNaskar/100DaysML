Based on amount of supervision need we can divide the types of Machine learning in 4 parts

SUPERVISED : When we both have input and output data and we need to establish a relationship between both.
|**\_\_** Regression : A type of a supervised machine learning and the data is numerical data we use regression method
|**\_\_** Classification : Another type of supervised machine learning which uses categorical data

UNSUPERVISED : When we have only input data we use the unsupervised learning.
|**\_\_** Clustering : helps in the ditection of identical group of data
|**\_\_** Dimensionality Reduction : Since there is large amount of input data we can reduce the dimension of the data(column deduction)
|**\_\_** Anomaly Detection : Detecting outliers
|**\_\_** Association Rule Based Learning : Based on human behavior and psychology associating data along the patterns.

SEMI_SUPERVISED : A bit of both supervised and unsupervised we can provide a small amount of data which can be scaled to large amounts.

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING : Without data or minimal data the models learn from the environment based on the experiences or the data it gathers.

BATCH LEARNING : A whole batch or the whole data is used to train the model. It is usually done offline.
Problems : Not always up to date.
Hardware Limitation.
Availability of the system.

ONLINE LEARNING : Real time training of the Machine Learning Model. The data is fed sequentially in small chunks to the model while being in the server.

How do machine learn?

INSTANCE BASED LEARNING : If a model is learning or mugging up the patterns then it is called instance based learning. I depends on mainly the clustering of the data to understand the patterns

MODEL BASED LEARNING : The model based learning tries to find a mathematical relation between the output and input.
